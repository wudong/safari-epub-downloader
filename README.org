* Safari Online books Epub downloader

** Introduction
Download book from Safari Online into ePub format.

The book reader from safari lacks in functionality and
usability compared to other ebook readers. I pretty much prefer Google play books to read/organize my ebooks. This
tool is developed for the purpose.


** Installation

Install pipenv, then
pipenv install

** Usage

python main.py --cookie cookiefile bookids

where the cookie file are cookies from the browser after login onto the safari online website,
and bookids are a list of book ids/

** grep the cookie
Because the safari website is not using when loggin, it is hard to login automatically through code.
To continue download the book from then, we need to first login on the website, download the cookie and
then we can use the cookie to download the epub.
